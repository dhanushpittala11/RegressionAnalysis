# RegressionAnalysis
 The Dataset that I picked up  is related to the life expectancy of 193 countries. The dataset consisted of various features like Life Expectancy,Adult Mortality rate, infant Deaths, Hepatitis B
 Measles and various other features. I analysed how the life expectancy is being affceted by other features present in the dataset and I analysed those features present in the dataset  that significantly
 affected the life expectancy.
